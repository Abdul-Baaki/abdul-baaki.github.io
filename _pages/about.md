I am a graduate student at the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, pursuing an **MSc** in Electronics and Communications Engineering. I hold a **BSc (first-class honors)** in Telecommunication Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. Throughout my bachelor's degree program, I was honored with the Faculty Excellent Students Award (Provost Award) on three occasions. I am also an alumnus of the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program, KNUST. With my strong foundation in telecommunications, I have served as both a teaching and research assistant at KNUST, contributing to various wireless communication and machine learning projects.
My research focuses on broad areas of wireless communication, resource sharing and utilization, wireless security, Internet of Vehicles, edge computing and computer networks. My work has led to the design and optimization of advanced vehicular edge-computing architectures, incorporating techniques such as RIS-assisted NOMA. I am committed to advancing the field of wireless communication through innovative research and collaboration.
