Graduate Research
======
**Task Offloading and Resource Optimization in Multi-access Edge Computing using Reinforcement Learning.**
* Designed an RIS-assisted NOMA-based Vehicular Edge Computing architecture as an environment for task offloading.
* Modeled the system for this environment and constructed a V2I transmission model using intra-edge and inter-edge interference of vehicles.
* Used distributed RL algorithms to optimize the offloading decisions to minimize the overall cost of computational offloading.
* Optimized the RIS phase shift parameters using Whale Optimization Algorithm.


Research Assistant - KNUST
======
* Path Loss Prediction based on Machine Learning: Trained various Regressors and compared the result to empirical path loss models.
* Worked on a project called "Providing Real-time Speech-to-Sign Language Translation using AI."
* Co-supervised undergraduate student's research projects (two groups of three students).

Class Projects
======
* **Keyword Spotting on the Edge**: Trained NN classifier to identify particular keywords, performed pruning, and deployed it onto a smartphone and Arduino nano 33 BLE sense. [Project Demo:Keyword Spotting on the EDGE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377628371_Project_DemoKeyword_Spotting_on_the_EDGE)
* Designed a Microwave Oscillator (5 GHz VCO) 
* Designed a Microstrip Patch Antenna at an operating frequency of 2.5 GHz 
* Designed a police siren using NE555 Timer 
Simulate the circuit on Proteus and solder it on a perf board to produce the exact sound.
* Engineering in Society project: Collected and analyzed data on malaria cases' effect on society and simulated a circuit that produced ultrasound frequencies to repel mosquitoes (electronic mosquito repellant) to keep the ecosystem safe.
